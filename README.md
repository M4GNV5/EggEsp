# EggEsp

An [EggBot](https://egg-bot.com/) is a machine for drawing on eggs. I built an [EggBot mini](https://github.com/ProbotXYZ/EggBot) which is similar but uses 3D printed parts and cheaper stepper motors.
As I'm using an ESP8266 for controlling the steppers and the servos I couldn't use the orginal firmware. This repository contains the software for my EggBot, (planned) features are:

- WiFi (it's an ESP8266 after all)
- taking svgs directly, no need for external software
- transmit files via tcp/ip instead of USB
- ...
